# SkillTree
Support autonomy with gamification

Self Determination Theory identifies three innate needs that, if satisfied, allow optimal function and growth:
- Competence, Relatedness and Autonomy. 
- Students can develop new cognitive skills better if they are intrinsically motivated to learn.
In this context, Skill Trees can help increase the level of autonomy in the learning process.
They can be used as gamification element to help students acquire serious skills in a fun way.

# This application makes it easy to create skill trees and monitor learning progress.
